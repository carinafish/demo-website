```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

you can insert different code language chunks via the green "insert" button
```{bash}

```

Make ggplot of cars, speed v. distance
```{r carsggplot, fig.cap='simple ggplot of car speed v. distance}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist, color=speed)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

show plot only, not code on rendered document via echo or 
show the code, but don't run it: use eval
ggplotly makes the graph interactive
```{r plotlycars, echo=FALSE}
ggplotly(
  ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist, color=speed)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
